# MIPS

A simple arithmetic logic unit for now, I'm writing this so I get a feel for Verilog and how it works.
Soon to implement most of the MIPS instruction set so I also get a feel for implementing basic assembly for an FPGA.

Current features:
- [x] 8-bit adder
- [x] Summation instruction
- [x] Subtraction instruction
- [ ] Current: 32 bit instruction memory 
- [ ] Multiplication instruction
- [ ] Division instruction
